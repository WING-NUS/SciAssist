First, creating a virtual environment in your project directory: 

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m venv .env

Activate the virtual environment.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    source .env/bin/activate

Now you're ready to install SciAssist with pip:

    pip install SciAssist

Setup Grobid for pdf processing
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to process pdf files, then you need to install Grobid Server. 
You will need to have Java installed on your machine. Then, you can install 
your own version of Grobid and get it running.
After you install the package, you can simply setup grobid with the CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    setup_grobid

This will setup Grobid. And after installation, starts the Grobid server with:

.. code-block:: bash

    run_grobid
